# fastaiVSpytorch
### Remi LeBlanc and Max Shinnerl

In this project our goal is to compare a language model and classifier created by fastai to a similar model written from strach wiht pytorch. To compare these model we are looking at several different factors including performace, ease of use, and model interpretability.
