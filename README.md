# fastaiVSpytorch
### Remi LeBlanc and Max Shinnerl

In this project our goal is to compare a language model and classifier created by fastai to a similar model written from strach wiht pytorch. To compare these model we are looking at several different factors including performace, ease of use, and model interpretability. 

### Our data
Our dataset consists of African new articles scraped from https://allafrica.com with the help of the USF mBio practicum team. These news articles are tagged by allafrica according to the article topics and themes. The dataset consists of about half a million news articles, half of which are in English and half in French. For this project we only used the English text articles.
